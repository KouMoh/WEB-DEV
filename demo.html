    <p>I see nor hear no evil <br>
        Black writings on the wall <br>
        Unleashed a million faces <br>
        And one by one they fall <br>
        Black-hearted evil <br>
        Brave-hearted hero <br>
         <strong> I am all, I am all, I am</strong> <br>
        I, I, I, I am <br>
        Here we go, buddy <br>
        Here we go, buddy <br>
        Here we go <br>
        Here we go, buddy <br>
        Here we go <br>
        Go ahead and try to see through me <br>
        Do it if you dare (dare) <br>
        One step forward, two steps back <br>
        I'm here (one step forward, two steps back) <br>
        Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it <br>
        Can you see all of me? <br>
        Walk into my mystery <br>
        Step inside and hold on for dear life <br>
        Do you remember me? <br>
        Capture you or set you free <br>
        <em>I am all, I am all of me</em> <br>
        I am (I am, I'm all of me) <br>
        I am (I am, I'm all of me) <br>
        I am (I am, I'm all of me) <br>
        (Here we go) <br>
        I see and feel the evil <br>
        My hands will crush 'em all <br>
        You think you have the answers <br>
        I'll laugh and watch you fall <br>
        Black-hearted evil <br>
        Brave-hearted hero <br>
